A B

A is
B is

A and B are
A and B

This shows how 'A B' is valid syntax for conjuction. Yet it is akin to 
ancient languages without fluff words and fillers, just throwing meaning at you.
But modern may is much more verbose, speak a lot say nothing vibe kind of way.

So if I say

image beach

I assume both are true in some kind of way. Here we can deduce we are referring
an image of a beach. Image is not a beach but is associated with it since it is a picture of it.
Some significant logic jump is made here, but non the less initial assumption is that both are true
is met in a bit broader sense.

Yet if I ask who will sit at that table?
And you say:

Marco Luca Natasha

This is set enumeration, not conjuction. Set enumeration is in fact disjunction.
As it is well known in mathematics, without any dilemma, as set theory is the basis of it.

x∈{a,b,c}≡(x=a)∨(x=b)∨(x=c)

This or this or this. But same syntax is used! Natural language is, as just described,
ambiguous in sense it overloads syntax for conjuction and disjunction.

While anyone who studies logic for just a bit knows those are almost like opposites.
Disjunction acts as union and conjuction as cutting.
So how come we use same syntax for both? Well see this implication

A & B => A | B

It is valid and very much the basis of said overloading.
So when I say

Marco Luca Natasha

I mean set enumeraiton, I mean any of them can sit at the table. More then that.
All of them can sit at the table. And if all do, well, some of them will sit there.
And that is justification for the overloading.

Now NLP, AI and those are hot topics. They are frontend of user centric systems.
And the fact UX is becoming more user centric is good. So any humane system should.
And there fore analyzing the limits of minimal syntax in case of simle thing
like conjuction and disjunction is important.

If we take ' ' as an operator, then, at least for conjuction we align formal language
and natural language, until we hit the ambiguity.

Formal languages traditionally are 'context free' for sake of simplicity.
So they can't handle this ambiguity based on context recognition.

1. who will sit at the table?
true NL: Marco, Luca and Natasha
and is obviously overloaded in its function. Here it is used as accentuation.
Expression is disjunction in logic as it enumerates a set and logically it would be
Marco or Luca or Natasha, and more precisely non exclusive or

2. what are you searching for?
image (that has a) beach (with) Marco and Luca 
that has a - signifies logical jump from instance to association with an object
and is aligned in logic and NL.

Then to makes things even worse NL uses or overloaded as both exclusive and non-exclusive.

image (that has a) beach (with) Marco or Luca
here its exclusive as if we wanted both we would say "and"
and if we wanted true logical or we would say "some of" or something like that

Taking everything into account, in attempt to untagle overloading of logical syntax
in NL we see that NL is simply to ambiguous for context free formal languages.


Yet not everything is so grim.
Context free formal languages in fashion of ancient languages throwing meaning at you
are possible. Especially with context recognition.

With context recognition:
We are expecting a set/list? then ' ' is disjunction.

without use a keyword "some of" "any" and continue using ' ' as both conjuction and disjunction.
Yields "anyOf Marco Luca Natasha" as disjunction.
and beach Marco Luca as conjuction.
