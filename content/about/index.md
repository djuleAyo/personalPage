## Informal

I guess since you are already here I can tell you about me not in CV kind of way.
Instead the truth.

* legos, puzzles and hours upon hours, sister calling me "crazy scientist"
* elementary school - soviet style - lazily filtered uni books and me learning them cover to cover
* math olympiads - notable achievements
* I start coding 2011 - uni - theoretical mathematics
* i took my time with uni digesting things at my own pace. I had hard time seeing how math, a temple of sense can be reduced to a job with no history of thought, offering answers to questions never asked, in context never hinted. I craved geometrical intuition not realizing hyperbolic and multidimensional spaces in that way yet
* few years later, before gql release I claimed between colleagues REST is too elaborate, we can do all that on one endpoin and wrote a lib that looked eerily like gql(80%). It used TS constants. This was the commencement of my main idea that Im still working on.
* 2016 I started working as web dev. Paycheck is a paycheck. Especially in Serbia. Grinded my way up to lead dev in US corp
* obviously not full time on my research but the intuition I had never stopped cooking in the background and knowledge gains converged towards it
* 2025 after 3 attempts I finally build a feature rich search engine - feature rich as in it rethinks the architecture of HMI, basing it self in
multifold innovations such as:
  * complete compile time runtime union
  * dynamically generated languages that close the loop - data, language interaction - trinity
  * relational referencing eliminating core coupling of reference and location. o1 ux complexity reference to anything
  * instruction as data
* Last year I build "bling typing" touch screen keyboard with remote control. Would love to grab that meta bracelet
