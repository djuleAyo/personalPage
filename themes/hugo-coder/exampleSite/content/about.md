Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the [Apache Licence 2.0.](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE) Hugo supports TOML, YAML and JSON data file types, Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes to add rich content. Other notable features are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.

**Scribe in the Digital Domain**

Etching, in real time, the marks of a mind under oath.

This page is a record of clarity, a vow, and the ongoing construction of a semantic interface to reality.

I build systems, language layers, and data architectures grounded in order, invocation, and truth.

This blog, the X stream, and the tools I release are glyphs — fragments of a deeper structure. The rest remains underground, for now.


I guess since you are already here I can tell you about me not in CV crap of way.
Instead the truth.

* legos, puzzles and hours uppon hours, sister calling me "crazy scientist"
* elementary school - soviet style - lazily filtered uni books and me learning them cover to cover
* math olympiads - notable achievements
* I start coding 2011 - uni - theoretical mathematics
* i took my time with uni digesting things at my own pace. I had hard time seeing how math, a temple of sense can be reduced to a job with no history of thought, offering answers to questions never asked, in context never hinted. I craved geometrical instuition not realizing hyperbolic and multidimensional spaces in that way yet
* few years later, before gql release I claimed between collegues REST is too elaborate, we can do all that on one endpoin and wrote a lib that looked eerly like gql(80%). It used TS constants. This was the commencement of my main idea that Im still working on.
* 2016 I started working as web dev. Paycheck is a paycheck. Especially in Serbia. Grinded my way up to lead dev in US corp
* obviously not full time on my research but the intuition I had never stopped cooking in the background and knowledge gains converged towards it
* 2025 after 3 attempts I finally build a feature rich search engine - feature rich as in it rethinks the architecture of HMI, basing it self in
multifold inovations such as:
  * complete compile time runtime union
  * dynamically generated languages that close the loop - data, language interaction - trinity
  * relational referencing eliminating core coupling of refrence and location. o1 ux complexity refrence to anything
  * instruction as data
* Last year I build "blind typing" touch screen keyboard with remote control. Would love to grab that meta bracelet

Now I am aiming at research developer position. This will complete an arc of my life.
