you need persistance to build muscle memory
you need patience to build and optimize your movement slow enough
you need inspiration to keep going

But even more then these you discover coevolution of language and thought.
Once one note was painful torture, then when expression opens and flow happens

Yet that is the essence of learning a language in more broad sense of the word.
Perfect hearing - a language, spatial understanding - a language.
For those barely initiated in letters expression seems as divine magic.">
