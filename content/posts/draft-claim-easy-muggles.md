Claim easy muggles

Everybody wants to be the one to claim in meetings
After all its often who appears to be working
Not who is working. So even greater plague then vibe coding
is vibe claiming.

Pillars of vibe claiming is
* appear good

so:
as soon as you have an idea or slightly understand ideas of others
start yapping and show how easy it will be
Never ever have multiple ideas and evaluate ideas not being attached to one
thats what geeks do bruv
since you are not a geek yap compensate

so good vibes only
* appear busy

If case is idea turns out underthought or lacking, and yap ideas always do,
then just continue yapping and be unable to recall shortcumings being pointed at
by geeks.

Be very confident while you yap, because while not everyone can speak 
articulated glyphs or arcane and technical origin
everyone can recognize confidence and vibes and keywords

oh yeah and final one
when someone calls you "claim easy muggle" go cry a river to HR and get out of my sight
