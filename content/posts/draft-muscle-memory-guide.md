# Guide to muscle memory

## Intro

In era before generative AI, published papers were still in domain of
sensationalism but I like to believe they had that much more substance.
One of these studies claimed

> Common trait of extremely successful people is they played an instrument

Now isn't that something?
* you need persistance to build muscle memory
* you need patience to build and optimize your movement slow enough
* you need inspiration to keep going

But even more then these you discover coevolution of language and thought.
Once one note was painful torture, then when expression opens and flow happens
the gap between what once was and what is now becomes seems almost unbridgeable.
Yet that is the essence of learning a language in more broad sense of the word.
Perfect hearing - a language, spatial understanding - a language.
For those barely initiated in letters expression seems as divine magic.

All this is seed of reason behind [UX metric](www.djuleayo.com/ux-merix) I was writing about.

> Developing muscle memory regarding UI control are letters of the language of 
machine command.

unfinished:

* don't use tree ui - o(n) ux complexity

navigation:
* os windows
* screens
* virtual screens
* tabs
* o1 file access
* o1 symbol access
* jump to definition, backward forward stack
* file sys ui for neighboring files
* go to line instead of o(n) arrow repeat
* jump word
* home end
* vim like direct access navigation
